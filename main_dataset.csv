It would be the same topic as what you're going to do at the national conference.,1,
"If so, I'll put you, Ian Suzuki, and Adam Timmerman on the schedule. Maybe one or two other people, also. I'll contact you later this month regarding timing details.",1,
"Everyone would be interested in hearing you talk at Hiroshima JALT in October! I hope you answer ""yes.""",1,
Hi Johanna! Thanks for the very nice e-mail. I just printed it out for Hiroko to read later today.,1,
"Wow, it sounds like Alicia and Monica had terrible times in the hospital. But I'm very happy to hear that they are better! And they seem to be very smart-- getting scholarships! No doubt they have good parents.",1,
In August Bob and I went canoeing for 5 days in the Boundary Waters of northern Minnesota. That was interesting. But there were mosquitoes and rain.,1,
"take care, Johanna. When you come to Hiroshima, we'll go out to arestaurant together!",1,
"It was great meeting you this week! You both are VERY NICE. The chocolate is in our refrigerator now. We look forward to eating it often throughout this fall! I hope things go well for you in the coming months, Amy and Howard! I'll send e-mail again soon.",1,
"How's everything going?? Things aren't going so well here.? They just let me know that they are cutting all the full time foreign staff here, so I will need a job next year. I was wondering if you know anyone that's hiring. If you do, please let me know.",1,
"Also I'm thinking of doing a presentation at Hirodai about how to database Hot Potatoes score results, and generally discuss cgi and html applications.? Are you interested?? I'm going to get in touch with Noda- san and see what I should do.? I'm thinking late August, or early September.",1,
"As kind and inviting as your suggestion is, I regret that I have to decline at this time.? Right now, both my wife and I have got a couple of extra things going on at work, and outside  f normal work.",1,
" I do think it would be a very nice thing to get together, but it's almost impossible for us during the week because even without the extra things we are doing now, our regular weekday evenings and Saturdays are busy with a myriad of activities - English classes, homework, karate, ballet, juku, hula, cheerleading practices, and so on.",1,
"Thanks for note!? I love the boundary waters--did we do it together in boy scouts?? It's the only time I've been.? My daughter Fay would love to canoe there--she's now a freshman at NAU in environmental science and goes backpacking whenever she can.? She always thought she'd go to UA in Tucson which is like UW -Madison in Wisconsin, but it turned out that the better program in env. sci. was here and the music program she wanted.? It's great having her this close.? Have you thought about college options for George yet?",1,
" Would a Sunday be convenient for you?? I was thinking maybe you'd like to see the base at Iwakuni.? You'd only need to take the train to Iwakuni Station, and I would pick you up and give you the grand tour of the base, as well as Iwakuni .? If a Sunday is not convenient, then how about a Japanese holiday - like this coming Monday?",1,
"I'm glad you enjoyed the TJ book.? We took a family trip to Washington, D.C. this summer and saw the sights and had a family reunion t here too. Great fun.",1,
"I'd love to see a photo of you all, and especially George!? Got one online you can send me? Come visit us and see Grand Canyon etc. next summer, if you can!",1,
"I've been meaning to write to everyone. But my life has just turned upside down the past few months. So, I'm glad you wrote. And thank you for the complement. You've always been very kind and supportive. I like you as well, and wish you all the luck at Hirodai and where ever else you and your family may go. And, thank you for your best wishes.",1,
"Yes, I've ""escaped"" Hirodai, but not under the circumstance I would have wished. In fact, I'm rather sad and disappointed that Koto-Sensei has not made clear my reasons for resigning. Both of my parents have been quite ill. I asked for an additional six nths leave to stay and take care of my parents. Koto sent me this amazing letter saying that while he thinks it was good for society that a law was passed making it possible for people to take compassion leave, no one should actually apply for the leave.",1,
"Well, any way, he made it very clear to me what was expected of me after I returned, and why I should return. After thinking about it for some time, I realized that if I did return then I'd still have to fly back to the USA often to take care of my parents; thus, I couldn't fulfill my responsibilities to Hirodai. It would also be an awful burden financially. I saw little options but to resign.",1,
"You are free to talk about this with others, but I will circulate a letter of my own soon. Right now, things are rather crazy. We're moving once again, something like the fourth time this year, and I've got a conference to prepare for. Take care and say hi to Sachiko and George for us!",1,
"I think I haven't told you yet.? After workin for? Kobe Kaisei Girls' Junior High School, I got a job here at Kure National College of Technology.",1,
"Anyway, coming home to Hiroshima, I resumed my research. I know what I have to do first: To publish the dissertation of mine ... When I was in Kobe, it was too difficult.",1,
"These days I finally finished writing a summary in English,? which is required for publication.? Prof. YAMADA gave me? some comments.? But I wonder if it is free of any unnaturalness.? Could you have a look at the attached file (it is the summary in question) and give me comments?  I'm not in such a hurry.",1,
"Thought I'd send out a picture of my little monsters.? They had a great Halloween yesterday.? Doreen and Dennis came over to hand out candy so Ray and I were both able to go out with the kids.? They made quite the haul, the dentist is going to love us!",1,
"Doreen and Dennis left this morning for Wisconsin.? They hope to get to Idaho today.? Judy, you should be seeing them sometime next week.I hope they have good weather.? They'll be back here in time for Thanksgiving.",1,
"I hope you are doing fine. I am now in Saitama, but will go back to Hiroshima to attend the conference. We would like to visit you to say thank? you for your cooperation. During this week, WED, THU, and FRI, please let me know when you will be in your office. We would like to visit you shortly.",1,
"After the exciting Saturday, I guess you've been doing as good as that Saturday.? The weather is good, food is good, and studying is good in this season.? I like this season the best.",1,

"While other major transportation companies have made rate increases over the past twelve months, this is the first time in over four years we have found it necessary to increase our rate structure.

"Be assured that we will continue to work with all our carriers, vendors and suppliers to keep costs as low as possible so that we can keep our rates competitive within our industry. ",2,

Thank you for your July 21st letter to my 2nd District Legislative Office . I welcome the opportunity to respond.,2,
"With respect to your Questions #1 and #2, please be advised I voted against and vigorously opposed the original deregulation bill specifically because of the potential negative impact on the local economy. The capping of rates at 10 percent lower than the market caused what is now history: a budget deficit of $100 million. The original deregulation bill also required state utilities to divest themselves of in-state owned generating facilities. I believe very strongly that the sovereign rights of the state should prevail over any federal initiatives in this area, and that Wisconsin should not be permitted generating stations located within the state to become deregulated.",2,
I trust my concerns will be useful to the Governor’s Task Force. Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to submit my comments and please do not hesitate to contact me if I may be of additional assistance.,2,

Approval for Setting up a Multimedia House,2,
"With Paramount reverence, I want to bring this into your kind notice that there has been a massive demand from universities and colleges in the South Delhi region to come up with a multimedia organisation that could cater for their internship needs. ",2,
You are aware of the fact that it is a time of media convergence and people are showing their prime interest in choosing multimedia as their prime source of information. And it is a good fact that multimedia news discrimination has overshadowed the traditional way of information dissemination. I believe we will take all the elements of multimedia into consideration. A fully-fledged animation branch will add feathers to our cap. We should take advantage of this emerging trend and set up a fully-fledged organisation in South Delhi. ,2,

I'm writing regarding the open content marketing role at 3L Logistics. My former colleague, and good friend, Lara Barrett, recommended that I contact you directly about this position. Lara and I worked together for three years at ABC Software company, so she can attest to my marketing know-how. I'd welcome an opportunity to discuss how my skills could benefit 3L Logistics and what you have in mind for this role.

Let me tell you a little bit about me: In my position as a marketing specialist at ABC Software, I helped to develop a content strategy for the release of ABC's next-gen software product, which covered both the Americas and EMEA regions. This work on the marketing funnel helped create 25% more opportunities for the sales team.

Prior to ABC Software, I was a communications manager at TechTom, another software maker. In this role, I developed a thought-leadership blog series that got picked up by mainstream publications and helped secure TechTom's role in the community as a reputable source of insight. Lara tells me that you're looking to pursue similar goals at 3L Logistics, and I'd love to share some of the best practices I discovered while working on this project at TechTom.

I think my mix of communications and marketing skills would be an asset to 3L Logistics. I would appreciate an opportunity to meet and discuss the role—and how I can help—further. Thank you very much for your consideration. ",2,

How's it going?

Sorry I haven't been in touch for such a long time but I've had exams so I've been studying every free minute. Anyway, I'd love to hear all your news and I'm hoping we can get together soon to catch up. We just moved to a bigger flat so maybe you can come and visit one weekend?

"As for me, I'll have been in the new job three months by the end of next week so I'm feeling more settled in. At first I felt like I had no idea what I was doing but now I realise it's normal to feel like that.

I used to work late a lot and at weekends but I'm slowly getting into a normal routine.",1,
"Hi Scott,
Thanks for the e-mail.? It is always nice to hear from people, especially
from you, Scott.

it was too difficult.",1,
"These days I finally finished writing a summary in English,? which is?

from him.? They want us to send the whole thing and also a ""Project?
Plan.""? It seems that they have some form to fill in to describe the project?
in Japanese, so I will write something which will appeal to the publsiher.",1,

After the exciting Saturday, I guess you've been doing as good as that
Saturday.? The weather is good, food is good, and studying is good in this
season.? I like this season the best.",1,
"Oh, well, this introduction may remind you of students' writing, so I
should stop it now.? To make a long story short (or the introduction?
short?), I am sending you this message to say thank you.? I said so for?
the Saturday already.? Today's ""thank you"" is to the vocabulary test,?
which was delivered to me today.? On the letter from Professor Tanaka,?
your name was also written, so I assume that you and Prof. Tanaka?
worked together to develop this test.? To tell you the truth, I like it, and I?
do want to use it for my research and classes.? He said that an online?
delivery is being planned.? I wonder if anyone can use the test.? If so, this?
is really great.",1,

"Hi Naomi,
???? Thanks for getting back to me. As I suggested, I would rather have
transportation reimbursed than honorarium. I will donate the

Friday afternoon at the earliest and Saturday morning at the
latest.",1,
"Hi Simon,

I'm now preparing a few materials for the? meeting this weekend. Basically,
I'll just introduce the Sadako's School program with some general

questions. How does that sound?",1,
